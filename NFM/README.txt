This is our implementation for the paper:

Xiangnan He and Tat-Seng Chua (2017). Neural Factorization Machines for Sparse Predictive Analytics. In Proceedings of SIGIR '17, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan, August 07-11, 2017.

We have additionally released our TensorFlow implementation of Factorization Machines under our proposed neural network framework.
